"""EFL-Tools unified text report — vocabulary + grammar, one answer.

A single command that runs both profilers over the same text and prints one
combined difficulty summary, instead of two separate invocations you have to
merge by hand:

  - **Vocabulary** — the CEFR band of the words (typical + 90% coverage),
    exactly as ``vocab_profile.py`` computes it.
  - **Grammar** — the CEFR band of the constructions used (typical + reaches),
    exactly as ``grammar_profile.py`` computes it.
  - **Blended estimated level** — one number: the higher of the vocabulary
    90%-coverage band and the grammar typical band, i.e. the level at which
    both most words and most structures sit comfortably.
  - **--target-level** — pass the class's level (e.g. ``--target-level B1``)
    and the report flags what exceeds it: the words above that level, the
    constructions above it, the coverage figure ("a B1 learner will already
    know ~92% of the recognised running words"), and a one-line verdict
    ("on level" / "reaches B2 — pre-teach 6 words, 2 structures").
  - **Readability** — a classic index (Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch–Kincaid
    grade) reported *alongside* — never instead of — the CEFR bands, for
    colleagues who still ask for a grade level. Disable with ``--no-readability``.

The vocabulary half is dependency-free Python 3; the grammar half needs spaCy
(``pip install spacy && python3 -m spacy download en_core_web_sm``) exactly
like ``grammar_profile.py``. When spaCy is missing the report still runs — the
grammar section is skipped with a note and the verdict is vocabulary-based.
Like ``grammar_profile.py``, a sibling ``.venv`` is auto-detected and used when
the invoking interpreter lacks spaCy.

Usage:
    python3 text_report.py --text "The cat sat on the mat." --target-level B1
    python3 text_report.py --file essay.docx --target-level A2 --format pretty
    echo "If I had known, I would have helped." | python3 text_report.py --target-level B1

Flags:
    --target-level    the class's CEFR level (A1–C2); the report flags what
                      exceeds it: words, structures, coverage, and a verdict
    --format          auto | json | pretty  (default: auto — a colour terminal
                      view when stdout is a TTY, JSON when piped/redirected)
    --text            inline text to analyse
    --file            path to a .txt, .md, .docx, or .pdf file to analyse
    --wordlists       override the vocabulary word-list directory
    --grammar-profile override the CEFR-J grammar-profile directory
    --no-grammar      skip the grammar side even if spaCy is available
    --no-readability  omit the Flesch–Kincaid / Flesch Reading Ease line
    --export          csv | md | flashcards — write the above-target words and
                      structures as a ready-made pre-teaching list for the
                      class: a CSV spreadsheet (type, item, level, count,
                      category, example), a Markdown handout (verdict +
                      coverage figure + a table per category, each row with an
                      example sentence from the text), or a flashcard deck CSV
                      in RubricMaker's import shape (word, definition, example,
                      phonetic, partOfSpeech). Requires --target-level. Decks
                      are enriched by default: definition/phonetic/partOfSpeech
                      are filled from the Free Dictionary API (no key) and the
                      in-text context sentence moves to the example column —
                      see --no-enrich. CEFR levels never come from the API:
                      they come from the bundled word lists.
    --cloze           render the exported examples as fill-the-gap sentences:
                      the target word (or construction span) becomes {{...}} —
                      RubricMaker's native fill-the-gap syntax, so the handout
                      doubles as a worksheet and pastes straight into a
                      fill-the-gap question there. Applies to --export md|csv.
    --suggest         the Phase 3 rewriting aid: for each above-target word
                      that has a curated alternative in the bundled list
                      (WordLists/synonyms.csv), suggest the simpler word —
                      shown in the above-target list (purchase → buy (A1)),
                      carried in JSON as aboveTarget.words[i].suggestion, and
                      added as a 'Simpler alternative' column in the
                      --export md|csv handout. Requires --target-level.
    --gap-report      the Phase 3 grammar gap report: with --target-level (and
                      the grammar side on), list the target-level
                      constructions the text does NOT use yet — the
                      'introduce these structures' list for graded-reader
                      authors. Carried in JSON as grammarGap.missing and
                      added as a 'Constructions to introduce' section in the
                      --export md handout. Incompatible with --no-grammar.
    --no-enrich       --export flashcards only: skip the Free Dictionary API
                      (the back of each card stays the in-text context
                      sentence instead of a plain definition)
    --dictionary-url  --export flashcards only: override the dictionary API
                      base URL (used to point at a proxy or a test server)
    --dictionary-cache  --export flashcards only: JSON cache file for dictionary
                      lookups, so repeat exports make no repeat requests
                      (default: ~/.cache/efl-tools/dictionary.json;
                      --no-dictionary-cache disables it)
    --pre-enrich      prime the dictionary cache from the input — a class word
                      list (one word per line) or a whole essay — with one
                      polite, rate-limited pass over the Free Dictionary API,
                      then exit (no report, no export). Words already cached
                      (hits and misses) are skipped; --delay SECONDS spaces
                      requests out (default 0.25, 0 for none); --limit N caps
                      new lookups. Later --export flashcards runs then answer
                      from the cache.
    --output          where the --export file goes (default: with --file input,
                      <stem>-preteaching-<LEVEL>.<ext> next to the source;
                      otherwise preteaching-<LEVEL>.<ext> in the cwd; decks
                      get a -deck suffix)
    --watch [SECONDS] the Phase 3 edit → re-check loop: keep re-profiling the
                      --file input whenever it changes on disk (polling every
                      SECONDS, default 1) until Ctrl-C — for tightening a
                      graded reader while the report updates on each save
    --curriculum FILE the Phase 4 curriculum checklist: check the text against
                      a file with sections [vocabulary] (one word per line)
                      and [grammar] (construction names as shown by the
                      grammar profiler, or their ids) and report pass/fail
                      coverage — vocabulary items also carry their CEFR band
                      when recognised. Grammar items are unchecked when the
                      grammar side is off. Carried in JSON as `curriculum` and
                      rendered in pretty mode and the --export md handout.
    --cambridge       the Phase 4 exam mapping: map the report's own CEFR
                      bands (vocabulary typical/reaches, grammar
                      typical/reaches, estimated level) to the matching
                      Cambridge English Qualification — A2 Key, B1
                      Preliminary, B2 First, C1 Advanced, C2 Proficiency.
                      Carried in JSON as `cambridge`, shown in pretty mode,
                      and rendered as a 'Cambridge English mapping' section in
                      the --export md handout.
    --cando           the Phase 4 Can-Do framing: express the text's demands
                      as CEFR global-scale Can-Do descriptors — what a learner
                      at the reached/estimated band can do, the language
                      rubrics and self-assessment forms already use. Carried
                      in JSON as `cando`, shown in pretty mode, and rendered
                      as a 'Can-Do descriptors' section in the --export md
                      handout.
    (stdin)           if neither --text nor --file is given, text is read from stdin

Output: with --format json, a JSON object that is a superset of both profilers'
payloads: ``vocabulary.results`` matches vocab_profile.py's ``results.cefr``
shape and ``grammar`` is grammar_profile.py's full payload, plus the unified
fields (``estimatedLevel``, ``targetLevel``, ``aboveTarget``, ``coverage``,
``verdict``, ``readability``). With --format pretty, a single combined terminal
summary.
